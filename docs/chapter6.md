# Chapter 6: Future Trends and Emerging Technologies
{: .no_toc }

## Abstract
{: .fs-5 .text-grey-dk-100 }

> With rapid advancements in communication and computing technologies and increasing demands for low latency and security, this chapter explores the future trends and emerging technologies in edge computing. It introduces recent paradigms like sky computing, meta computing, and computing power networks, which complement and enhance aspects of edge computing. This chapter highlights the growing recognition and integration of edge computing across diverse fields, examining its role in emerging scenarios such as orbital edge computing, large language models, and 6G.

<div class="course-project">

<div class="project">
<b>1.</b> Deploy large language models, such as Edge-LLM (<a href="https://github.com/GATECH-EIC/Edge-LLM" target="_blank">https://github.com/GATECH-EIC/Edge-LLM</a>), LlamaEdge (<a href="https://github.com/LlamaEdge/LlamaEdge" target="_blank">https://github.com/LlamaEdge/LlamaEdge</a>), on heterogeneous
hardware and explore the segmentation of specific models at different layers in an edge
computing environment, observing the changes in transmission costs and computational
costs.

<!-- How to show the reference number as we are not show the references here. -->
<div class="project">
<b>2.</b> Inspired by the concepts discussed in the paper ‚ÄúThe Internet of Things in the Era of
Generative AI: Vision and Challenges,‚Äù Wang et al. [40] select a specific IoT application
(e.g., smart home, healthcare monitoring, and industrial IoT) and explore how generative
AI can be applied to enhance its functionality.
</div>

<div class="project">
<b>3.</b> By leveraging open-source projects, construct scenarios for cross-cloud and cross-domain
edge collaboration. Consider using communication networks from different telecom
operators to simulate cross-domain edge collaboration, and try to understand the
distinctions between sky computing, computing power network, and meta computing in
comparison to edge computing. Recommended open-source projects include: OpenFaaS,
KubeEdge, and Kubernetes.
</div>

<div class="project">
<b>4.</b> Utilize the open-source project Cote (<a href="https://github.com/CMUAbstract/cote" target="_blank">https://github.com/CMUAbstract/cote</a>) to explore
the principles and applications of orbital edge computing.
