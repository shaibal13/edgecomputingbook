# Chapter 2: Fundamentals of Edge Computing
{: .no_toc }

## Abstract
{: .fs-5 .text-grey-dk-100 }

> This chapter provides a detailed exploration of edge computing's fundamental technologies, models, and essential concepts within the framework of distributed computing. It examines the bidirectional computation flow central to the edge computing model, featuring technologies like computation offloading, 5G/6G communication, advanced storage systems, and lightweight libraries. Key edge programming models are introduced, emphasizing that edge computing complements, rather than replaces, cloud computing. The combined power of edge and cloud addresses big data challenges efficiently, while edge computing's advantages and current challenges are discussed across application, architecture, and theoretical dimensions.

## üìò Course Projects
{: .fs-5 .text-grey-dk-100 }

<div class="course-project">

<div class="project">
<b>1.</b> Conduct a comparative analysis of Hadoop MapReduce and Apache Spark for big data processing. By setting up Hadoop and Spark to perform a specific data-processing task, the performance can be measured and compared in terms of execution time, resource usage, scalability, and ease of development and debugging.
</div>

<div class="project">
<b>2.</b> Design and implement a hybrid edge-cloud computing system for real-time data processing. The edge-based component can be set up in a basic edge computing environment, and the cloud-based component can use a cloud service provider (e.g., AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud).
</div>

<div class="project">
<b>3.</b> Explore the impact of latency on application performance. Set up a cloud-based application and measure its performance, then replicate the application in an edge computing environment and compare the results. Utilize tools like <a href="https://prometheus.io/" target="_blank">https://prometheus.io/</a> for monitoring and <a href="https://grafana.com/" target="_blank">https://grafana.com/</a> for visualization to measure and compare latency.
