# Chapter 7: Case Studies and Practical Applications
{: .no_toc }

## Abstract
{: .fs-5 .text-grey-dk-100 }

> This chapter explores the transformative impact of edge computing on data processing, analysis and action, moving computation and storage closer to data sources. It examines six major sectors‚Äîmanufacturing, IoT retail, healthcare, telecommunications, autonomous vehicles, and smart cities‚Äîhighlighting the practical effects of edge computing on operational efficiency, decision-making, and innovation. Through real-world case studies, the chapter illustrates how edge computing reshapes these industries, driving advancements and offering solutions to unique challenges within each sector.
