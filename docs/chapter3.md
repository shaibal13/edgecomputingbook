# Chapter 3: Architecture and Components of Edge Computing
{: .no_toc }

## Abstract
{: .fs-5 .text-grey-dk-100 }

> This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of edge computing architecture, categorizing its components into on-premises edge, network edge, and data center edge, each representing a unique deployment approach. Through collaboration with cloud and peripheral devices, edge computing enables powerful data processing, caching, storage, and efficient content delivery. The chapter also examines four collaborative models within edge computing: edge-to-edge, edge-to-device, edge-tocloud, and cloud-edge-device, each enhancing interoperability across various layers. Finally, the chapter emphasizes the importance of network integration in supporting smooth data flow and communication in distributed systems, highlighting how strategic model selection can optimize system performance.
